# Label-Free GNSS Spoofing and Jamming Detection

This repository provides the reference implementation for the paper:

**A Label-Free Framework for GNSS Spoofing and Jamming Detection  
with Cluster-Level Semantic Inference**

The proposed framework performs GNSS anomaly detection without using any ground-truth labels during training or inference. Instead, it combines unsupervised representation learning, statistical modeling, clustering, and large language model (LLM)–based semantic reasoning at the cluster level.

## Overview of the Pipeline

The overall workflow of the code is summarized as follows:

1. **Unsupervised Representation Learning**  
   Label-free GNSS training data are used to train a dual-branch CNN autoencoder (`AE.py`), which extracts compact latent representations from multi-dimensional GNSS observations.

2. **Statistical Modeling in Latent Space**  
   A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is fitted on the autoencoder latent features using training data only (`GMM.py`), providing a probabilistic description of nominal signal behavior.

3. **Unsupervised Clustering on Test Data**  
   Latent features extracted from test data are grouped via unsupervised clustering (e.g., KMeans) (`kNN.py`), forming cluster-level structures without any label information.

4. **Cluster-Level Feature Summarization and Semantic Prompting**  
   For each cluster, statistical summaries are computed (`feature.py`) and converted into structured natural-language descriptions (`prompt.py`) for LLM-based semantic inference.

5. **GMM–LLM Fusion and Final Decision**  
   Cluster-level semantic risk scores generated by the LLM are fused with sample-level GMM posterior information (`Concat.py`) to produce the final anomaly decision.

All modules operate in a fully label-free manner; ground-truth labels are used only for offline evaluation and are not required by the framework itself.

## Notes

- The framework does **not** rely on labeled GNSS data for training or inference.
- All clustering, modeling, and semantic reasoning are performed in an unsupervised or label-free manner.
- This repository focuses on the offline analysis pipeline. Extensions such as real-time inference and additional visualization tools may be released in future updates.
